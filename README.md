# Mix

Mix of two algorithms: first one exploits the 10% deviation from daily open price on GBPUSD pair and the second one exploits daily retracement from 75%, 87.5% or 100% levels.

The only parameter is iteration number, which is an arbitrary integer serving to label positions - its value has no effect on algorithm's performance or behavior.
